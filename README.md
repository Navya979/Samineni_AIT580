# Samineni_AIT580
Hello Everyone!

I am Navya Samineni currently pursuing Master’s in Data analytics and engineering at Mason. You can reach out to me at nsaminen@gmu.edu

I have worked as an application development associate at Accenture, India. My main area of expertise is database management which is extracting and processing data as per client requirements. I have a solid foundation in programming languages like Python, R and SQL using which I have spent a lot of time performing data analysis, manipulation in IDE’s like Pycharm, Spyder.

This constant passion to derive insights for making data-driven decisions for business problems is what led me to choose Data analytics as my major.

I hold a bachelor’s degree in Electronics and communication engineering.

Working with windows environment has been my day-to-day job and also I have a slight working knowledge of Ubuntu.

I am excited to learn more about big data from this course which is one of the essential skills to become a data scientist and get guided under Myong Lee of whom I got great feedback.

Thank you

Nice meeting all of you.
